this small game demonstrate how we can create a simple semi text-graphic adventure game. 
Since game,player were written as class, it is possible to add many items,creatures. 
first question in my mind was how to connect the rooms with each other. so i wanted to write class and first i made 4 walls. so i wanted to open doors later according to my map. 
now, game has very small and a few commands. but anyroom can be added. moreover, it is so easy to add photos of rooms that is visited by hero. 
actually, game logic is simple. I have also full text version of this game to test game logic. you need to download part_1 file, room8 file,hero_icon,opening file and cover.jpg file to run program. I prefered to write as seperate file to make it secure and easy read. 
good luck.
